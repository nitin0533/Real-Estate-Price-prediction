# Real-Estate-Price-prediction
## Resume Points
**Implement Regression model for Real-estate price prediction**
1. Performed data cleaning, Exploratory data analysis, and Feature engineering of the dataset using Pandas library
2. Performed Outlier detection and removal by analysing the Mean & Standard deviation and Visualisation of dataset
3. Implemented GridSearchCV to search for best regression model, and trained the model with 80-20 dataset split

**Implement Regression model using Scikit-learn for Real-estate price prediction**
1. Performed Feature engineering, Outlier detection & removal by analysing the Mean & Standard deviation, and Visualisation of dataset
2. Implemented GridSearchCV to search for best regression model, and trained the Linear Regression model with 80-20 dataset split

The code and dataset are attached in the GitHub. Snips from code are attached for the quick verification.
